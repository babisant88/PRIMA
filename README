The program is an implementation of the PRIMA algorithm (shown in Fig. 4 of the attached paper).

In order to build the program just call make.

In order to run the progrma type in the command line %Prima <C> <G> <B> <D> <n> <N> <q>

, where C is the Capacitance matrix, G is the Conductance matrix, B is the input port-to-node connectivity matrix, 
D is the output port-to-node connectivity matrix, n is the total number of nodes, N is the number of ports and q is the number of
moments to match in the reduced model.
